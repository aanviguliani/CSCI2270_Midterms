\f0\fs24 \cf0 i went by implementing this function by first implementing the BST class and writing all of the functions for the starter code. then, i created the sum range function and in that function, i called a recursive helper function. in this, i checked to see if it was less than or equal to the max and greater than or equal to the min and if so, i had a return statement that added it to the sum recursively.}
