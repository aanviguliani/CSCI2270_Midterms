\f0\fs24 \cf0 I commented most of my code out but I went about this problem by implementing a linked list using a class linked list with simple functions (adding/deleting nodes and initializing the linked list). Then, to my class I added a sumEvens function that traversed through the linked list and summed up all of the even values. The condition for this was that if the key value divided by two had a remainder of zero, add the key value to the sum. In my main, I created a linked list object and tested multiple situations to check my code.}
