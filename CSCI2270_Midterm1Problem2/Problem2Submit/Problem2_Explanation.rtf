\f0\fs24 \cf0 I commented most of my code but to go about this problem, I used a similar class as I used in Problem 1, and created a splitList function in my main. I did this by traversing though the \'93big linked list\'94 with both even and odd functions. If the key value divided by two had a remainder of zero, I added it to the even linked list. else, i added it to the odd linked list. I kept track of where to add the node by creating variables previousEven and previousOdd. If previousEven/Odd were -1, I would add it to the head of their respective linked list and set the previousEven/Odd to the new value. Else, I would add it to middle of the linked list and set the previousEven/Odd to the new value.}
